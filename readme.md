# Kernel-Density-Estimation Stock Trading Algorithm
This final project was an open ended project for ECE 133B (Numerical Computing 2) where we could propose our own projects, my proposal can be found in `proposal/project_proposal.pdf`. Some more important files are:
- `report/file.pdf` the final report.
- `spectral_clustering_kernel.py` contains my algorithm
