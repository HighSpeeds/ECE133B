# ECE 133B Final Poject, Kernel-Density-Estimation Stock Trading Algorithm
This final project was an open eneded project where we could propose our own projects, my proposal can be found in `proposal/project_proposal.pdf`Some more important files are:
- `report/file.pdf` the final report.
- `spectral_clustering_kernel.py` contains my algorithm
- `spectral_clustering_naive.py` contains the baseline.
